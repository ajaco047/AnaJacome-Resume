        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second year Pre-Business major hoping to concentrate in Finance or Management. I am currently affiliated with two different organizations on campus. One club/organization I am a member of is the Office of First Time College Student. I currently hold the position of Financial Coordinator and I oversee the team's budgets and where it is best to spend money accordingly. Aside from the financial aspects of the organization, I also work with many students from various backgrounds where I must continuously work on my communication skills to understand the needs of all members as well as get new ideas for the teamâ€™s financial endeavors.<br><br>

        Another club I currently work at is UCRâ€™s Unmanned Aerial Systems. This is an engineering club but I was chosen to assist the business side. I took part in this opportunity because I believe working around engineering as well as with people from different backgrounds and majors would make me a better co-worker and a more versatile employee for the future. I currently assist the manager with acquiring sponsors to assist our group of engineers with knowledge or financial donations. We hope to participate in the upcoming competition for drones by getting as much support as we can.<br><br>

        One club I was a part of for about 6 months was the Orange County Sustainability Decathlon at UCR. I was the Business Lead for the group where I handled the budget, spoke to various Presidents and CEOs of many companies to get as much assistance as we could. Holding this position not only taught me the importance and value of hard work but also helped me understand that things are done faster when everyone works together and everyone is on the same page. I consistently made sure to text or call my teammates and made sure they saw their upcoming tasks and reminded them to complete it on time. I believe this is what allowed us to get into the competition, which was hard work and teamwork. In regards to job positions, I was a server at the restaurant T.G.I. Fridays for about 5 months. This is where I learned the importance of remaining professional with all customers. It is very difficult to meet the needs of customers at times but remaining kind and courteous is what got me through the days. I learned how to communicate effectively with customers and managers without causing any trouble. I also learned the importance of responsibility and commitment. As a server, one is responsible for the needs of the customer, such as food, drinks, hospitality, and comfort. The server must adhere to the needs of the customer and maintain a comforting and inviting atmosphere.
